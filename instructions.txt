1)instructions
terminal_id => get from sup_institution table
course_staff_same_department,course_staff_same_faculty,course_staff_same_programme,course_staff_same_institution are set for an institution
you can pay school fees with j_regno where level = 100, school fees are configured for levels and programmes.
CRUD for sch_fee_type,sys_application_level may be created later, for now we can seed the tables.

2)table explanations:
sys_application_level => this table contain application_levels for actions e.g if a fee is created and applied to Faculty as application_level, then when the fee is used, it should check tomake sure the
person affected belongs to the faculty_id in that row. i.e if application_level_id column is 7 then u should expect a value in the faculty_id field in the sch_fee table, if 8 then expect the student to
belong to both faculty_id and same level within the faculty.
sch_fee_check_exclusion => a fee setup in the sch_fee table can be excluded for some indivduals, matric_no, jambites or even staff.any person in this table will not be checked for this fee.
sch_fee_type => contains all the possible fee types for the school.more can be created using CRUD or seeding directly into the table.
sys_global_settings => contain data for the system, some keys like these course_staff_same_department,course_staff_same_faculty,course_staff_same_programme,course_staff_same_institution are now resident in institution table.
sup_institution => now modified to contain these fields, so please adjust the institution setup to contain these fields,default value is 1 for the fields apart from terminal_id
				'terminal_id' => '7009158828',
                'course_staff_same_department' => 1,

                'course_staff_same_institution' => 1,
sys_payment_type => contains the 3 payment types: full,first installment and final payment.so during fee check, you have to check if the amount paid corresponds to any of this payment type for the fee.
sch_payment => log each payment confirmed to this table.the fields can be obtained from the response from the payment gateway.
sch_fee =>

                'application_level_id' => 10, // this fee is configured for programme/level so all 600 level students in degree (programme_id = 1 is degree)
